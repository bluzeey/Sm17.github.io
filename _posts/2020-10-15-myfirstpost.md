# Changes in methods of learning and How I learn :
## Doing without Thinking :
Well , well , before you jump to any conclusions what I mean by the same , isn't that you shouldn't do coding if you don't know the same . Coding is the art of exploring and experimenting. What I mean by the same , is try to understand how every single line affects the working of a program . I had started exploring Machine Learning by doing Kaggle Learn Courses. However , all I did was to somehow solve the guided tutorial without going into depth of how it works and now I regret the same . 

## Don't stop when you get stuck : 
One of the irrefutable truths is the fact that you are going to get stuck once you start to code . However , don't get discouraged and leave it . Personally , I still feel such a urge to leave the problem and do something else . Try to solve it by knowing the syntax or the previous versions until the code was working fine.

## Learn Concepts rather the lines: 
The most important thing while learning is to understand the concept of lines rather than the lines . You will never be able to use direct codes , there always would be a need to use different lines for different tasks that you want to do . So rather be sure you understand the concept . In the end, even if you get hint of what library you would need to solve the problem . You will complete your task.

## Making notes of Codes snippets:
Throughout learning coding one of the things , which will make it useful for you is to have any utility scripts or functions which are important to be stored . Not only will they save you time , whenever you will have a new task at hand. You will also ingrain the concepts that much better.

## Learn from the masters: 
Try to find if there is a existing solution to a problem present , and learn the code snippet and understand it as much you can , even if you feel like you may never be able to reach such levels of sophistication, you may learn a lot from the same .


# Changes in the Mindset while Coding :

## Daily Devotion:
Through our school life and college , a lot of us have learnt the habit of doing things just the night before . However, like any habit coding requires time and daily practice , this one of most important lessons I have learnt . Coding is like a muscle, which requires exercise everyday , or else it becomes useless.

## Learn with a Bigger Purpose: 
When you learn coding , not only do you have the power to run some little computer programs, you also have the power to change the world. 
A lot of people , learn Machine Learning , for the huge pay , but it leads to discouragement when what they really target is just the materialistic happiness which money might provide , you can use Machine Learning in numerous ways . With the evergrowing possibilities , there is a need of innovation in so many fields . So try to keep , a bigger image in your mind .

## Savor small moments : 
One of the things , which I have grown to appreciate overtime is the small problems , and the eurekas! when you solve them . Even if your project is huge , if you have somehow completely debugged even small block of code , it is a big deal and even a incentive to not stop.
Keep on learning and don't stop !!!
